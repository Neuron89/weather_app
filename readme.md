# purpose
---
 The goal of this project is to add another module to the cli fetch *Fastfetch.* I enjoy the aspect of having some of my more pertinent information on display as I open a terminal and the idea of adding personalized weather seemed like an obvious addition.

## goal
---
The goal isn’t always to create something but it is always to learn something. I’m sure if I looked, someone has already done this. I decided to make this on my own to learn some different skill sets
- api calls
- JSON imports
- JSON dumps
- Better understanding of conditional statements 
	- Case statements
	- For/If statements 
	- Using ranges in a list
- Export/import variables and functions 
- The Importance of exporting environment variables so as to not expose my own api tokens
---
### progress 
---
So far I have accomplished 
- Location tracking
	- able to pull IP address to get IP based location to display weather information 
		- Looking into how I could refine/be more accurate with that information. 
- API 
	- successfully calling and API 
	- Creating specific variables based on information output 
	- handing those variables off to other scripts 
- Logic statements
	- Used the information to display the weather conditions in a graphical format
	- Referenced time of day to compare sunrise/sunset to display a sun/moon
	- Used a statement to map ranges to specific numbers to add graphical moon phases when displaying the moon
- Json
	- imported the information 
	- Exported the information as JSON 
		- trying to figure out how to add this to *fastfetch.*
			- I think I might need to pull the source code and build it myself so I can add a module that the configuration file can use.
